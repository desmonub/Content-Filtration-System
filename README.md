# Content Filtration System

This project is a **Content Filtration System** built to analyze and flag explicit content from user input. The system is designed to ensure that content remains appropriate and safe for all users. It leverages modern techniques to filter and classify text, providing a 'yes' or 'no' output based on the content's nature.

## Features

- **Real-time Content Analysis**: Automatically filters and flags explicit content as the user types.
- **Customizable Filtration Rules**: Easily modify the filtration logic to suit different needs.
- **Interactive Testing**: Includes a suite of tests to ensure the filtration logic performs accurately.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Production builds are minified and optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Easily deployable to various environments with pre-configured build scripts.
